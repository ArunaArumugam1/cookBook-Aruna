Ingredients

    600g red onion, finely sliced
    2kg tomato, chopped
    4 garlic cloves, sliced
    1 red chilli, chopped (optional)
    7cm piece ginger, peeled and chopped
    250g brown sugar
    150ml red wine vinegar
    5 cardamom seeds
    Â½ tsp paprika

Method

    STEP 1

Tip all the ingredients into a large heavy-based pan and bring to a gentle simmer, stirring frequently. Simmer for 1 hr, then bring to a gentle boil so that the mixture turns dark, jammy and shiny. Place into sterilised jars and allow to cool before covering. Will keep for 6 weeks.

Changes:
I usually don't add vinegar and sugar.
